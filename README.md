Due to the decrease in the number of free hosting for the backend, I have to use a hosting that sleeps when not in use. When you start the application, the server will wake up and after 30 seconds you can refresh the page, and then it will work correctly. The application itself works fine.

Launch steps:
1. git clone + link on repo
2. npm i
3. npm run dev
